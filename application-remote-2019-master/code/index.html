  <h1>WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT?
  </h1>

    <p> JavaScript is a programming language,
    written over a period of <em>  just 10 days  </em> in 1995!
    Along with <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"
    title="HTML wiki page" target="_blank">HTML</a>
    and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets"
    title="CSS wiki page" target="_blank">CSS</a>,
    it is one of the
    three vital technological
    pillars of the World Wide Web. It is commonly
    used to add client-side behaviour
    to web pages, such as webforms
    and interactive game content.
    In 2019, <strong>  95% of all websites
    used JavaScript for client-side programming.  </strong>
    Its basic syntax is deliberately similar to both
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" title="Jave wiki page"
    target="_blank">Java  </a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B"
    title="c++ wiki page" target="_blank">C++</a>,
    making it easier to transition
    between them. However, despite the similarities
    of their names and syntax, <strong>  JavaScript differs
    significantly from Java.  </strong> </p>
